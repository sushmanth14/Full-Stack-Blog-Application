Project Title: Full-Stack Blog Application

Project Overview:

The Full-Stack Blog Application is a web-based platform that allows users to create, publish, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as comment on them and filter posts by categories. The application will have a user-friendly interface, robust backend functionality, and a scalable database architecture.

Functional Requirements:

User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out of the application.
Blog Post Management: Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts, including adding titles, content, and categories.
Commenting System: Users can comment on blog posts, and comments can be displayed below each post.
Category Filtering: Users can filter blog posts by categories, and categories can be created, edited, and deleted.
Search Functionality: Users can search for blog posts by title, content, or category.
Responsive Design: The application will have a responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Technical Requirements:

Frontend: The application will use React.js as the frontend framework, with Create React App as the development environment.
Backend: The application will use Node.js as the backend framework, with Express.js as the web framework.
Database: The application will use MongoDB as the database management system, with Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.
Security: The application will implement authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password hashing.
Deployment: The application will be deployed on a cloud platform, such as Heroku or AWS, using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: The application will have a response time of less than 2 seconds for most requests.
Scalability: The application will be designed to handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users.
Security: The application will implement security best practices, including input validation, error handling, and secure password storage.
Usability: The application will have an intuitive user interface, with clear and concise instructions for each feature.
Project Timeline:


Source Code: The complete source code for the full-stack blog application.
Documentation: A detailed documentation of the application, including technical requirements, architecture, and deployment instructions.
Deployment: A deployed version of the application on a cloud platform.
